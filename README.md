## What does it solve?

When you use Razorpay Storefront pages to receive orders, you run into two annoying problems:

1. **Unhelpful emails**: Razorpay only sends payment amount and Payment ID in emails, not what your customer actually ordered!

2. **Confusing dashboard**: If you check the order in the Razorpay dashboard, you just see internal JSON with product IDs instead of a friendly view of what was purchased.

This tool fixes that by simply adding `#storefront` to the URL - which makes Razorpay show the order details in a human-readable way. (Yes, it's that simple!)

## How to use it

1. Access the tool: https://razorpay-lookup.pages.dev
2. Enter your Order ID (like `order_Q7iGFi26KGX7M7`) or Payment ID (like `pay_Q6iIK4pinZmyXQ`)
3. Click the button
4. See your order details in a readable format!

## The honest truth

You can actually just manually add `#storefront` to any Razorpay order or payment URL yourself. This tool just saves you the typing.

The mobile view of Razorpay's dashboard still isn't great - but that's Razorpay's problem, not ours! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
